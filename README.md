# blackMacro
This is a ultra light weight macro creator for the guild Black Bull. 

I created this program, because I was bored, but I saw that it is actually a good idea to publish it.

Functions: Create custom scripts for your minecraft farm or build an anti AFK bot, by writing simple commands in a text document

There is a free lite version, with a few drawbacks, but you can also request the premium version. I will probably give it to you for free too. Just do not want to have it public.
